         <h1>Our History</h1>
         <p>Trippy is definitely a How High son that sets himself apart. He is freaky to look at from behind wide massive top, square hip, while still holding enough extension. Trippy walks around with so much athletic ability like he owns the place. He is known as the show pony around the barn. His white face features make him impossible to miss. You can appreciate the immaculate front end How High put into this son. We plan on utilizing him on every ewe on the place.</p>
         <h1>Our Mission</h1>
         <p>Mission statements explain why a brand, a proposition or a product exists and what its relatable role is in the here and now. Although, quite rightly that ‘here and now’ can be seen as not vanishing anytime soon.</p>
         <h1>Our Vision</h1>
         <p>A vision statement is not just a strapline. It can be “a vision of the experience ‘you’ (the brand) want to be known for, beyond a tagline, framed by the values the brand should seek to project at each and every user interaction.</p>
